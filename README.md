# Maze-Generator
Initially built as an extension, it is a small maze game that randomly generates a maze each time you play.
Coded in HTML and JS.

Uses the p5.js library to draw the maze so I **don't** claim ownership of the code in the file *p5.min.js*.  No changes were made from original library file. Link to the p5 repo: https://github.com/processing/p5.js

The rest of the code is written by me.
